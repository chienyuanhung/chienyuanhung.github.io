        <p>I am an accomplished biomedical data scientist with a Ph. D degree in Biochemistry looking for data scientist position in the biopharmaceutical industry. I started my career as an experimental scientist and ventured into genomic and biomedical image data analysis during my postdoctoral training. I am passionate about using visualization tools to reveal the information under the data collected from biomedical experiments. This year, I further sharpen my ability in data science by taking the Data Science and Visualization Bootcamp at the University of California, San Diego. I have more than 7 years of experience writing Python and R codes for modeling, analyzing and visualizing results. I also design and develop experimental assays and am skilled in experimental bench work.  My cooperators including chemists, engineers, and computer scientists and my works could be found in many high-impacted journals such as Developmental Cell, Current Biology, and PNAS. I am looking forward to continuingly using my skills to make an impact on future work.
